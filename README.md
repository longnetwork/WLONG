This Smart-contract of a BEP-20 token obtained by burning a LONG COIN to an address 
without a private key: `1111111111111111111114oLvT2`. After burning you get a unique coupon 
in the amount of burned LONG. This coupon is used to top up wLONG at your address 
in Binance Smart Chain.
This token has no central authority to issue currency. **TotalSuppy** is created by everyone at their own discretion 
by burning LONG coin in the original blockchain.
**wLONG** provides mechanisms to exchange BNB and other tokens via the **uniswap** protocol, as well as 
to profit from creating liquidity on decentralized exchanges such as https://pancakeswap.finance/

**1.** Install a MetaMask wallet that supports BEP-20 tokens (https://metamask.io/download/) 
   Go through the MetaMask installation steps and get an account with your address

    ![](https://longnetwork.github.io/assets/images/mm_wlong15_16_17_18.png)  

**2.** The second method is to use DEX exchange **PancakeSwap** (You can adjust the price and influence the price of the token):
   - Go to PancakeSwap https://pancakeswap.finance/swap and connect MetaMask (BSC network)  
   ![](https://longnetwork.github.io/assets/images/mm_wlong19.png)  
   - You will need to give PancakeSwap access to control the wLONG token once. To do this, 
     in the **Swap** window click on the token selection arrow, then in the window that opens click on **"Manage Tokens"**, 
     then on **"Tokens"**, in the field below enter the **wLONG** smart contract address: `0x8E54a1a32dFd86Eb5c6F5334351502E1bff3Ce49`
     and click on **"Import"**. Confirm that you trust the token and click **"Import"** again  
    ![](https://longnetwork.github.io/assets/images/mm_wlong20_21_22_23.png)  
   - Press **"Enable wLONG"** and pay Gas once to access your **wLONG** balance on **PancakeSwap**.  
    ![](https://longnetwork.github.io/assets/images/mm_wlong24.png)  
   - Now let's start exchanging by adjusting the price based on the **PancakeSwap** information messages.
