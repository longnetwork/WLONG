This Smart-contract of a BEP-20 token obtained by burning a LONG COIN to an address 
without a private key: `1111111111111111111114oLvT2`. After burning you get a unique coupon 
in the amount of burned **LONG**. This coupon is used to top up **wLONG** at your address 
in Binance Smart Chain.
This token has no central authority to issue currency. **TotalSupply** is created by everyone at their own discretion 
by burning LONG coin in the original blockchain.
**wLONG** provides mechanisms to exchange BNB and other tokens via the **uniswap** protocol, as well as 
to profit from creating liquidity on decentralized exchanges such as https://pancakeswap.finance/

## How to add **wLONG** to your wallet (MetaMask):

**1.** Install a MetaMask wallet that supports BEP-20 tokens (https://metamask.io/download/) 
   Go through the MetaMask installation steps and get an account with your address:

     At the end click **"Send Payment"**:  
    ![](https://longnetwork.github.io/assets/images/mm_wlong10.png)  
   - After 6 confirmations of the **LONG** network, you will get a signature to write to the smart contract and get **wLONG** to balance in MetaMask:

**2.** Go to the data write page of the contract:  
       https://www.bscscan.com/token/0x8E54a1a32dFd86Eb5c6F5334351502E1bff3Ce49#writeContract  
   - Connect MetaMask by clicking **"Connect to Web3"**. If the connection is successful, the status should change to **green**:  
     ![](https://longnetwork.github.io/assets/images/mm_wlong12.png)  
   - Find method 4. **"mint"** and enter in the amount and signature field the data obtained after burning **LONG**. Then press the **"Write"** button:  
     ![](https://longnetwork.github.io/assets/images/mm_wlong13.png)  
   - Make sure MetaMask doesn't pop up a **"red warning"** that means you made a mistake when you entered the data!!! 
     If all is well, press **"Confirm"** and... Voila!

## How to exchange wLONG for other tokens:

**1.** The first method is directly from the MetaMask wallet:  
    ![](https://longnetwork.github.io/assets/images/mm_wlong15_16_17_18.png)  

**2.** The second method is to use DEX exchange **PancakeSwap** (You can adjust the price and influence the price of the token):
   - Go to PancakeSwap https://pancakeswap.finance/swap and connect MetaMask (BSC network):  
   ![](https://longnetwork.github.io/assets/images/mm_wlong19.png)  
   - You will need to give PancakeSwap access to control the wLONG token once. To do this, 
     in the **Swap** window click on the token selection arrow, then in the window that opens click on **"Manage Tokens"**, 
     then on **"Tokens"**, in the field below enter the **wLONG** smart contract address: `0x8E54a1a32dFd86Eb5c6F5334351502E1bff3Ce49`
     and click on **"Import"**. Confirm that you trust the token and click **"Import"** again:  
    ![](https://longnetwork.github.io/assets/images/mm_wlong20_21_22_23.png)  
   - Press **"Enable wLONG"** and pay Gas once to access your **wLONG** balance on **PancakeSwap**:  
    ![](https://longnetwork.github.io/assets/images/mm_wlong24.png)  
   - Now let's start exchanging by adjusting the price based on the **PancakeSwap** information messages:

**3.** Now that you've mastered **MetaMask** and **wLONG**, move on to the professional level and don't forget to give a **wLONG** like ;)

*Note. You can choose any tokens to exchange (not just BNB), but Remember that you must always have some BNB on Gas!*  

## How to become an exchanger, a market maker and make money by providing liquidity for the exchange:

**1.** Open https://pancakeswap.finance/liquidity and connect MetaMask (the **"Connect"** button in the upper-right corner):  
   - After connecting the wallet, click **"Add Liquidity"**:  
   ![](https://longnetwork.github.io/assets/images/mm_wlong29.png)  
   - Select tokens in the **wLONG** and **BNB** liquidity pool, enter the deposited volumes (the system will make 
     presets at the current price). Edit the volumes so as to change the price in the desired direction and by the desired percentage:  
   ![](https://longnetwork.github.io/assets/images/mm_wlong30_31_32_33.png)  
   - Grant PancakeSwap access once to control the **wLONG** token, if you have not done so before, and click **"Supply"**. 
     Then click **"Confirm Supply"** and pay a small Gas:  
   ![](https://longnetwork.github.io/assets/images/mm_wlong34_35_36.png)  
   - After confirming the network you just need to remember to add **Cake-LP** in a wallet!!! (this token liquidity providers and is needed to make a profit) 
     and realize that you are now an exchanger and get a percentage of each exchange ;)
