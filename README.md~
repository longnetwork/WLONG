This Smart-contract of a BEP-20 token obtained by burning a LONG COIN to an address 
without a private key: `1111111111111111111114oLvT2`. After burning you get a unique coupon 
in the amount of burned LONG. This coupon is used to top up WLONG at your address 
in Binance Smart Chain.
This token has no central authority to issue currency. **TotalSuppy** is created by everyone at their own discretion 
by burning LONG coin in the original blockchain.
**WLONG** provides mechanisms to exchange BNB and other tokens via the **uniswap** protocol, as well as 
to profit from creating liquidity on decentralized exchanges such as https://pancakeswap.finance/

## How to add **WLONG** to your wallet:

**1.** Install a MetaMask wallet that supports tokens (https://metamask.io/download/)

## How to exchange WLONG for other tokens:
**1.** The first method is directly from the MetaMask wallet:  
   - Open MetaMask (BSC network) and click the **"Swap"** button. In the fields **"Swap from"**, **"Swap to"** select the desired tokens. 
     You may need to enter **"WLONG"** in the search line and confirm that you trust the token by clicking **"Continue"**  
     ![](https://longnetwork.github.io/assets/images/wlong14_15.png)  
   - Next, select the desired direction of exchange, enter the desired amount and click **"Review Swap"**  
     ![](https://longnetwork.github.io/assets/images/wlong16_17.png)  
   - Once again, verify the expected result and click **"Swap"**  
     ![](https://longnetwork.github.io/assets/images/wlong18_19_20.png)  

*Note. You can choose any tokens to exchange (not just BNB), but Remember that you must always have some BNB on Gas!*  

**2.** The second method is to use DEX exchange (using **PancakeSwap** as an example):
   - Go to PancakeSwap https://pancakeswap.finance/swap and connect MetaMask (BSC network)  
   ![](https://longnetwork.github.io/assets/images/wlong21.png)  
   - You will need to give PancakeSwap access to control the WLONG token once. To do this, 
     in the **Swap** window click on the token selection arrow, then in the window that opens click on **"Manage Tokens"**, 
     then on **"Tokens"**, in the field below enter the **WLONG** smart contract address: `0xf7fC9143be8488BEbC3424533920316E627E17D1`
     and click on **"Import"**. Confirm that you trust the token and click **"Import"** again  
    ![](https://longnetwork.github.io/assets/images/wlong22_23_24_25.png)  
   - Press **"Enable WLONG"** and pay Gas once to access your **WLONG** balance.
